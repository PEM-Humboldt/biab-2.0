    description: Numerical value referring to the EPSG code (European Petroleum Survey Group) associated with the spatial reference system that will be used as a reference for the study area. This numerical value specifies the projection and geodetic datum used to define the coordinates and spatial representation of the data in the study area. For further information on coordinate systems and EPSG codes, you can access the official database on the EPSG website at https://epsg.org/home.html. The website provides documentation, resources, and tools for searching and understanding the EPSG codes used in various geospatial contexts.

    description: Text string referring to file path of the generated WKT file (.txt) that represents the boundaries of the study area. The WKT (Well-Known Text) file is a text-based format that describes the geometry of the boundaries of the study area. The structure of the WKT file includes a geometry type label (MULTIPOLYGON) associated with the coordinate values of the vertices that define the boundaries of the study area mask.
