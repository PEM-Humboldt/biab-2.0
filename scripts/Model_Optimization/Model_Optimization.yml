    description: Text string representing the file path to the spatial file containing the spatial boundaries pertaining to the study area. Accepted file types include shapefile (.shp), raster (.tif/GeoTIFF) or  GeoPackage (.gpkg). This path specifies the complete path location of the file within the file system and is utilized for identifying and accessing the spatial boundaries contained within the file.

outputs:
  Selected_variables:
    label: "Adjusted variables"
    description: Text string referring to file path of the generated WKT file (.txt) that represents the boundaries of the study area. The WKT (Well-Known Text) file is a text-based format that describes the geometry of the boundaries of the study area. The structure of the WKT file includes a geometry type label (MULTIPOLYGON) associated with the coordinate values of the vertices that define the boundaries of the study area mask.
